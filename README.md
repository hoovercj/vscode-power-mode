# VSCODE OSU Mode!!!

OSU Mode is a fork of Power Mode, they said it shouldn't be done...

However, after being bored and realizing that VSCode was not the only modern editor without it, I knew I didn't have to try, but I couldn't let VSCode live in the shadow of its big brother or Atom.

I present you, **VSCODE OSU MODE**!!! (now with Genshin Impact Characters!)

![DEMO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ao-shen/vscode-power-mode/master/images/demo-osu.gif)

To enable OSU mode, add `"osumode.enabled": true` to your settings.
To disable combo counter, add `"osumode.enableComboCounter": false,` to your settings.
To enable letter explosions at the cursor when you type, add `"osumode.enableCursorExplosions": true,` to your settings.


## Features:
* NEW: COMBO COUNTER
* Everything Power Mode has
